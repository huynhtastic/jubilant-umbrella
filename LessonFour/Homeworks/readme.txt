By the time you see this, I'm probably a few dollars richer. Let's face it: it'll be a while before you can find me.

Let's play a game.

You're trying to find me, and I'm trying to find another genius to join me in my escapades.
You figure this out, you can have your money back, and I can have another partner to have fun with. 

A win-win? We'll see.

You guys call me Lurk, The Lurker, whatever. Call me whatever you want. I'm a face with many names. 
But the word on the street is someone's already cracked my first cipher. 
If you're reading this, I know that person is you. If you aren't, then good luck.

Riddle 1:
You can see that your logs might look a little... vague. That might be an understatement.
The point is, you cracked my first cipher, but that was easy. Now, prepare for trouble. And make it **DOUBLE**.

**HINT** **HINT**

Once you understand my first riddle, you'll know that you're missing two key words:
Riddle 2: (THIS ONE FIRST!)
Multiplies; but never breeds, Uses air; but never breathes.
Consumes much; will never eat, Often measured by its heat.

Riddle 3:
My name is short, yet my history long.
Once I was the greatest one, but now, all but my core is gone.
Known for might and buildings and art,
At last I fell, now stories they tell.
Who am I?
