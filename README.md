This is the repository used for the lessons taught for learning programming in Python and PERL! 

We will be working from the ground up starting with Python to learn the basics of programming to more advanced topics. Homework assignments can be pulled from here, as well as code that was shown in class.
Topics will be shown in PERL as well to translate lessons to applied work for inside teams.

If you haven't already, sign up for a GitHub account! You will probably use this for a huge part of your life as developers.

# Python Setup
The lessons in Python will use the latest iteration of Python (at the time of writing this will be Python 3.5.1). This will ensure that you will be learning a version of Python that will be supported for the foreseeable future. Alongside Python, we will be using an IDE (integrated development environment) called PyCharm and GitBash/SourceTree. The links to the items that you will need to have installed on your computer are here:

  * Python 3.5.1: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
  * PyCharm Community Version: <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows>
  * Git Bash: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
  * SourceTree: <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>
