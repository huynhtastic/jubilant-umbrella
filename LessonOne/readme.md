# Homework Assignments
I have a few homework assignments that I would like for you all to work on. Our next lesson is on Wednesday, so if possible, please finish these assignments by then. Please do not copy/paste code. All code should translated from your brain, to your fingertips, to your keyboard, and finally to your PyCharm. These lessons and homeworks are for you to be able to learn and get a headstart on your computer science classes.

I encourage collaboration if you need help or to bounce ideas, but definitely try to do these on your own first. I am not grading, and I am defintely not looking for the cleanest, or the most efficient code. But if you feel the need to do code in that fashion, then by all means. Here are your first assignments:

### 1. Dr. J. Dan's Guest Greeter
We start off our coding adventures with Dr. J. Dan, a prominent neurosurgeon at the Spintel Hospital. He was recently promoted as the head of neurosurgery at Spintel Hospital and is throwing an ice cream party to celebrate his achievement! (Congrats!) To be as welcoming as he can be to his guests, he wants a program that his guests can use to greet them as they come in. Dr. J. Dan has zero coding experience, but luckily for him, you have come to his aid and offered to create this program for him.

He wants the program to allow guests to put in their first and last names, their age, and their favorite ice cream flavor. From that information, he wants the program to print out their full name, their age, and their favorite ice cream in the form a nice little greeting. The example he gave was:

"Welcome, Richard Huynh! Congratulations on being on this planet for the past 22 years! Have as much strawberry ice cream as you want at the party!"

### 2. The root(s) of all evil
After finishing that program for Dr. J. Dan, you walk with a grin from cheek to cheek, proud of your successful work for him. On your way back home, you see a high school kid throwing a tantrum at a park. You go up to him, ask him for his name, and why he's so mad. He reveals himself as Charley, a student attending Gintel High School. His Algebra 2 teacher recently taught the class how to find the roots of any given polynomial containing real roots using the "Quadratic Formula", but he has no idea how all of that voodoo-magic works.

He wants you to help him by writing a program that will print out the roots of any given a, b, and c. He will put in a, b, and c, and the program will spit out two roots for any polynomial with real roots. If the equation comes out with imaginary roots, the program will print an error. Leave the error. He's a high school kid. He can deal with errors.

### 3. Tell me the TRUTH
After getting a good night's rest from a long day of programming, you wake up to the sound of a police car in front of your yard. You go down to see Officer Hanro, a warrior of justice for the city of Cintely. He comes to you out of breath, asking you for help to decipher the schedule left at the scene of a crime. He cannot figure out what is what, but after hearing about how you created the Guest Greeter for Dr. J. Dan's ice cream party, he came to you first to help him solve it:

(TRUE or FALSE): Here's a hint to help you catch me... if you can. But is it really a hint? We'll have some fun with this!

Seeing this boolean logic before, you figure that evaluating the Boolean to a single value will help figure out which statement is true, or false! You run to your laptop to calculate it with Python, but you find your laptop battery dead, and you realize that you forgot the charger at Dr. J. Dan's. Officer Hanro stresses that he needs this problem solved ASAP, so you decide to figure this out with paper and pencil:

(TRUE and TRUE): At 5:00PM, I woke up from my cot at the corner of 28th and Freeo.

(FALSE and TRUE): At 6:00PM, I zipped down to the docks and slipped on a banana.

(TRUE or FALSE): At 7:00PM, I walked past the Spintel Hospital and saw a cute dog.

((TRUE or FALSE) and FALSE): At 8:00PM, I followed the dog back to its owner, but oh man it has an owner.

((TRUE and TRUE) and TRUE): At 9:00PM, I found the dog's dog house in the backyard, but it's not there yet.

((TRUE or FALSE) or (FALSE and FALSE)): At 10:00PM, I see the dog coming out for a potty break. Is it time to make the snatch?

((TRUE and TRUE) and (FALSE or FALSE or TRUE)): At 11:00PM, I have the dog. I'm making a break for it!

((FALSE and TRUE) or (TRUE and FALSE) and (TRUE and TRUE)): At 12:00AM, I forgot my keys at the house. I gotta go back.

((TRUE or FALSE and TRUE) and (TRUE or FALSE and TRUE)): At 1:00AM, I took the dog out for a walk at Intelee Park. HE'S SO CUTE!

(TRUE and TRUE and FALSE or TRUE and FALSE or TRUE): At 2:00AM, I decided to name the dog Genie. He's definitely a husky. Freakin' cute I swear.

(((TRUE and FALSE or TRUE) and (FALSE or TRUE) or (FALSE and FALSE)) and TRUE): At 3:00AM, I forgot to leave a cool riddle at the scene of the crime. I'm going back.

((TRUE and TRUE) or (TRUE and FALSE) or (TRUE and FALSE) and (TRUE and TRUE)): At 4:00AM, I remembered that I had already left the riddle. I'm the best.

((FALSE or TRUE) or (FALSE or TRUE) or (TRUE or FALSE) or (TRUE or FALSE) or (TRUE or FALSE) or (TRUE or FALSE)): At 5:00AM, I'm gonna go have breakfast at a dog friendly place. Probably like P. Husky's.

[For the purpose of this problem, write out what you think the result of the Boolean logic is, and then use Python to see the actual result.]
